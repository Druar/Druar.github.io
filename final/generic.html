							<p> Do you want to get more out of your clothing and stop wearing the same few things?
								When most people buy clothes, they imagine all the different ways they’ll be able to wear their new purchases.
								These will be the pieces to diversify their wardrobe…or so they tell themselves when they buy them.
								What usually ends up happening is that they pair their new items in a few different outfit combinations, and can’t seem to style them any other way.
								If this sounds like a familiar frustration, you can take comfort in knowing that there’s a psychological explanation.
								Simply put…human beings are creatures of habit.
                           </p>Once we have a pattern in place, it’s very hard for us to break it. And once we see something enough times (like our go-to outfits) it becomes significantly more difficult for us to see it any other way.
						   This is the primary reason you stand in front of your closet each morning, feeling less than inspired to get dressed, even with a wardrobe full of clothes.
						   Because the problem is rarely the quantity of what you own, but an inability to take what already exists, and style it in new ways.
						   How cool would it be to have a personal style catalogue, with a wide variety of fresh new outfit combinations, using the clothes you already own?</p>
						   
							<p> Some of the outfits would be for work, others for date nights and vacation…and every time you stepped out of your house, you were wearing something different.
								If your answer to that question is very cool!, then a Look Book is absolutely for you.
								And the best part is, the process couldn’t be easier.</p>
							<p>  You give us pictures of what you own and we take care of the rest!
								All that’s left for you to do is open your book, choose a combination, and find the corresponding clothes in your closet.
								You get the maximum utility out of what you own, have endless outfits that serve you….all without any frustration! </p>
