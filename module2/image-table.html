    <a href="https://cte.bc.edu/ADIT1340/images/croc.jpg"><h2>American Crocodile</h2></a>
      <p>The American crocodile can be seen throughout the lowlands of Costa Rica, 
         gliding along rivers or sunning on muddy banks. It has a long, strong 
         tail, a scaly suit of armor and a very powerful set of jaws. The American 
         crocodile’s eyes, ears and nostrils are located on the top of its head, 
         giving the croc a low profile while swimming through the water.
         Thanks to their short legs, American crocodiles generally crawl along on 
         their bellies, however, they are capable of “galloping” at a surprisingly 
         fast pace. In the water, they often use their bodies and tails to swim 
         rapidly in short bursts when necessary.
         An adult male American crocodile averages 13 feet in length and weighs 
         approximately 400 pounds; his female counterpart is about 10 feet long and 
         weighs only 160 pounds. The species can live up to 70 years, and is 
         partial to warm, brackish waters – its habitat consists of river mouths, 
         salt lakes, brackish rivers, estuaries and even the ocean. American 
         crocodiles are most often found between southern Florida and Peru, with a 
         high concentration in Costa Rica.</p>

    <a href="https://cte.bc.edu/ADIT1340/images/vertical.jpg"><h2>Costa Rican Cloud Forest</h2></a>
      <p>eliminated most of the world’s tropical montane cloud 
      forests years ago and continues today.  Unfortunately even areas like 
      Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve  which are protected from logging are 
      threatened as rising world temperatures move the elevation where the 
      clouds first form higher and higher.
      Scientists have found that plants and animals from lower climactic 
      associations have been encroaching on the reserve and other Costa Rican 
      cloud forest areas for decades.
      The lowland rainforests are creeping up the hills and the cloudforests are 
      being pushed off the mountaintops.  Visit while you still can.</p>

    <a href="https://cte.bc.edu/ADIT1340/images/sloth.jpg"><h2>Sloth doing what sloths do best!</h2></a>
      <p>There are two species of sloths: two-toed and three-toed. Although the 
         name is misleading given that all sloths have three toes. Actually the 
         species name refers to the number of fingers. But two-toed sounds way 
         better than two-finger! So let’s not duel on that. Their main physical 
         differentiation, apart from the fingers, is their coloration (At least for 
         the two species of sloths in Costa Rica).
         Three-toed sloths tend to be a grey color, with a white face mask that 
         makes them look smiley all the time. Two toed sloths tend to be more beige 
         to brown and lack the face mask but still offer a great smile. Three-toed 
         sloths also possess an extra cervical allowing them to turn their head 270 
         degrees! Also three-toed sloths are diurnal while two-toed are nocturnal.</p>
