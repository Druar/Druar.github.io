<caption>Released 27 years ago, Hocus Pocus has become a cult classic family film. Set during Halloween in Salem, the story is pretty thin, however, it still entertains and holds its own after all this time.

    The Sanderson sisters are three witches who need to drain the energy of children to remain young. Led by Winifred the trio end up being hunted down by town folks in the 1700’s and become an urban legend in town. Once a teenager named Max accidentally brings them back to life in modern times, they have only a few hours to drain another child before dying again. Max, his kid sister Dani and Allison, the girl he’s in love with have to fight to stop them fulfilling their wish.
    
    it’s a quite charming and heartwarming film. 
    
    The witches coming back to life after 300 years on Halloween is a great set up for plenty of “fish-out-of-water” jokes, and the Sanderson sisters have very funny moments while adapting to the 20th century. Even stepping on a paved road is a new adventure, and the three actresses have a blast in those moments. And for a 27-year old film, the visual effects to the most part hold their own, even the talking cat.
